          Who needs convenience when you can have peace of mind knowing that your money is locked up tighter than a padlock on RINA Bank's front door (which, by the way, doesn't exist)?
          But don't worry, if you ever need to contact the bank, just send a message in a bottle and hope it reaches the right place.
          Or maybe just stick with the website and hope for the best. After all, who needs a physical address when you have an "Easy to Use" website?
